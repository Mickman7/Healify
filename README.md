# 🩺 Healify

Healify is a specialised mobile application developed to assist patients with kidney disease in monitoring their health. Created as a final-year university group project, the app provides a reliable tool for calculating **eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate)** and offers an educational resource for patients to better understand their condition.

## 👥 Collaborative Development

This project was developed in a cross-functional team, simulating a real-world software engineering environment. The team consisted of:

* **Developers** (Technical implementation and logic)
* **Designers** (UI/UX and prototyping)
* **Testers** (Quality assurance and bug tracking)
* **Project Manager** (Sprint planning and delivery)

We utilised **Jira** for agile task management, **Figma** for high-fidelity designs, and **GitHub** for version control and collaborative coding.

## 💻 Technologies

* **React Native** (Cross-platform Mobile UI)
* **Firebase** (Database & Authentication)
* **JavaScript** (Application Logic)
* **Figma** (UI/UX Design)
* **Jira** (Agile Project Management)

## ✨ Features

* **eGFR Calculator:** A precise tool allowing patients to input their medical data and calculate their estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate to monitor kidney function.
* **Educational Hub:** A curated library of information where users can read about kidney disease, treatment options, and lifestyle management.
* **User Profiles:** Secure account creation via Firebase to store and track health data over time.
* **Intuitive UI:** A clean, accessible interface designed specifically for patients managing chronic illness, focused on readability and ease of use.

## 📁 The Process

The development of Healify focused on accuracy and accessibility. As a developer on the team, I worked closely with the design team to translate **Figma** prototypes into functional **React Native** components. 



We followed an Agile methodology, using **Jira** to manage our backlogs and sprints. The core technical challenge was ensuring the eGFR calculation logic was medically accurate and that the **Firebase** integration provided a seamless, real-time experience for the user. Working alongside dedicated testers allowed us to identify edge cases in the calculation inputs, ensuring the app was safe and reliable for patient use.
